# (WIP) Meteorological Grib Reader
This is still very much a **work in progress**. As work on the library is continuing, we expect a first version to be ready in November/December 2015. We appreciate your patience. In the mean time; feel free to watch and star.

This library will allow you to read grib files into JAVA objects. Grib files (commonly found with the extentions .grb, .grib or .grib2) are binary files used in meteorology to store historical and forecast weather data.
  
*More information about the library and basics examples on using the library will be added at a later stage in the development*
